			<p> Hi there! If you're here, you're part of Ross's Sunday Eberron game. Alternatively, you've somehow stumbled upon the wrong website. Either way, welcome! Sentient robots, soaring airships, and a continent torn apart by a hundred years of terrible warfare await you.</p>
			<p>For us players, <a href="https://tinyurl.com/sunday-ashes">here's the session zero document.</a> It has the social contract, along with the character creation stuff, feats, and alla that.</p>
			And <a href="https://tinyurl.com/lanterntower">here's the Journey to the Lantern Tower spreadsheet we're using!</a> It has the gold we've spent, as well as the interactions we're having aboard the Copper Rose.

					<td>This variant uses a short rest of 8 hours and a long rest of 7 days. &#40;DMG, p. 267.&#41;</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Dragonshards and Resource Regeneration</td>
					<td>You can use 1 pound of Red Dragonshards to regain a 1st-level spell slot or a feature/trait that takes a short rest to recover, 2 pounds for a 2nd-level spell slot, 3 pounds for a 3rd-level spell slot or a feature/trait that takes a long rest to recover, and so on with higher-level spell slots. You can do this with the Use an Item action, provided you have the requisite amount of Eberron/Red Dragonshards. If you &#34;consume&#34; more pounds of these dragonshards per day than your proficiency bonus, you'll suffer magic poisoning, which has varying effects that grow more severe the further past your limit that you push. &#40;Ross, d. 2020-02-12.&#41;</td>
